                            <h3 style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>About our Belgian Chocolate</strong></h3>

                            <p style="padding-left: 30px;">We source our chocolate from one of the rare chocolate makers
                                that still selects, roasts their cocoa inside the shell of the bean itself, and finely
                                grinds its own cocoa beans, with a process that yields a more intense and richer cocoa
                                flavor. The final recipe yields a fine Belgian chocolate that has been expertly crafted
                                for
                                the perfect texture, aroma, and taste.</p>

                            <h2><strong>How Chocomize got started</strong></h2>

                            <p>Chocomize was founded in 2009 by three recent grads from Columbia University.&nbsp; The
                                idea
                                for custom chocolate bars began with a mistake involving some sweets and chocolate and a
                                hot
                                summer day, melting everything together to form the first Chocomize bar.</p>

                            <p>&nbsp;</p>

                            <p>Realizing they had an opportunity on their hands, Fabian Kaempfer, Eric Heinbockel, and
                                Nick
                                LaCava created Chocomize in hopes of capitalizing on the trend of mass customization and
                                fulfilling the need for customized chocolate that was not being fulfilled in the United
                                States.&nbsp; Chocomize became the first e-commerce in the United States to empower
                                people
                                to create their own chocolate bars with their favorite ingredients.</p>

                            <p>&nbsp;</p>

                            <p>Chocomize now calls New York City home and has expanded to offer not only make your own
                                chocolate bars in other shapes but other chocolate products like truffles, hot chocolate
                                on
                                a sticks, and seasonal favorites. Bulk orders are also available for chocolate corporate
                                gifts like gourmet gift baskets and party favors for birthdays, weddings, and special
                                events. Chocomize bars can now be found in various gift shops and stores around the
                                country.</p></div>
